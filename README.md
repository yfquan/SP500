# S&P 500 Analysis

## Introduction

In this analysis, we will explore the S&P 500 dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks?select=sp500_stocks.csv). Our primary objective is to examine how portfolio composition influences risk and expected returns.

To achieve this, we will:

- Conduct a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, including key statistics and visualizations.
- Evaluate different portfolio compositions and their impact on performance.
- Use Monte Carlo simulations to model potential outcomes under varying market conditions, helping us assess risk and expected returns.

This analysis will provide insights into portfolio diversification, volatility, and the trade-offs between risk and reward in equity investments.
